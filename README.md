How Long Until Messi & Ronaldo? r/soccer Bot
============================================

Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are widely considered the two greatest footballers of their generation, and have been competing for the majority of the last decade.
As with any historic sporting rivalry, it is difficult to separate the two, and any achievement or discussion around one of the players will inevitably attract mentions of the other, which are often unwanted and unnecessary.
